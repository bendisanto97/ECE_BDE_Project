# ECE_BDE_Project
ECE ING5 - Big Data Ecosystem Project 

In this project, we used Apache Hadoop and Elasticsearch Hadoop MapReduce (ES-MR) technologies. 
To implement our project, we used a Linux Ubuntu 22.04 ISO with VirtualBox and the Kibana tool from Elasticsearch on a Windows 10 PC. 
The goal of this project is to be able to index a very large sample access log file which was generated in the Apache Combined Log Format and visualize the data with Kibana.
